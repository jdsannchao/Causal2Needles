You have a pair of sentences: one indicating a cause and the other describing its effect. Your goal is to rephrase both sentences so that the causal relationship between them is explicitly clear. Please ensure that after rephrasing,  there is a piece of shared information present in both sentences that establishes the causal relationship between them.
